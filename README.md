# N-Body Gravitational Simulation using parallel C++ codes

# Desrciption :
An N-body gravitational simulation to simulate the movement of planets, stars etc. over an expansive space. These codes contain parallelized versions of the same in OpenMP, MPI and CUDA.

# Include Files

The include file contains the class definition of a vector type to store 3D polar coordinates.
